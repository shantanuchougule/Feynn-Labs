# McDonald's Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to segment McDonald's customer base using machine learning techniques, specifically **KMeans clustering**. The segmentation helps to identify distinct customer groups based on their preferences, visit frequency, and demographic features. These insights can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies, customize product offerings, and improve customer engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `sklearn`: For implementing KMeans clustering and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset (e.g., `mcdonalds.csv`).
- **notebook/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis (`McDonalds_Segmentation.ipynb`).
- **images/**: Stores visualizations (e.g., Elbow Method plot, PCA plot).
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the project.
